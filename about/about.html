		<p><b>Philosophy:</b> Kale polish was founded by two people with a dream: to create a premium, eco-friendly nail polish company. Through extensive research over the past twelve years in the fields of Palau Island, they discovered the extensive benefits of Brassica Oleracea for the human nail. Their products are infused with kale extract which helps to fortify and strengthen the nails with vitamins and nutrients. Kale Polishâ€™s hope is to deliver a high-end experience using natural ingredients.</p><br>
	

		<p><b>Our method:</b> The process begins with dehydrated Kale leaves that are crushed up, creating a powder.  This powder with then mixed with other special ingredients to form the perfect polish consistency and color.  We found that when Kale is incorporated into our nail polish formula, it benefits nails tremendously, by strengthening and helping to stimulate growth and shine.</p>
